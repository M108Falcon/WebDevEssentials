# Basic Tetris
Created using Vanilla Javascript, a basic game of tetris that just focusses on core game mechanic.  
Tried using FlexBox for styling.  
Things to improve:  
[  ] Make positioning of elements dynamic.  
[  ] Improve overall styling.  
[  ] Add Better graphics to game.  
[  ] Levels  
[  ] Multiplayer(maybe)
